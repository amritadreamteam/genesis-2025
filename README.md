- Add a README to your solution repository with a link to your fork of the `div-it-up` repository.  

**Recommended Duration: 4 days**


## Development Cycle

Every application or website we see has a journey behind it, commonly known as the development cycle.

- The development cycle begins with creating a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document, which outlines the project's requirements and goals. While creating a comprehensive SRS document is beyond the scope of this curriculum, you will create a much smaller version here.
- Next, detailed visual designs are developed using Figma, focusing on the look and feel (UI and UX) of the website.
- Following this, front-end and back-end development is carried out, with the front-end handling the user interface and the back-end managing data and server logic.
- Finally, both are integrated to ensure seamless interaction between the user interface and the underlying systems.

**The following is a list of features that should be included in the website you create, along with important points to remember while working on such a project. After reading these, you can proceed with Task 05, where you will start working on this website by creating an SRS document!**

### The Website You Are Going to Create:

**Fable** is a social platform for book enthusiasts where users can discover, review, and discuss books, as well as interact with a community of like-minded readers. It allows users to create reading lists, log books they’ve read, and share reviews. Additionally, it offers curated lists, book recommendations, and the ability to follow other users to see their activity. Visit the site: [Fable](https://fable.co/)

### Features to Adopt for a Similar Website:

1. **User Authentication:** Sign-up, sign-in, and social media login.

2. **Search Functionality:** Search for books by title, author, genre, or publication date.

3. **Review and Rating System:** Users can write reviews, rate books, and edit or delete their reviews. Remember, other users can review the books you have added, just as you can rate the ones they have reviewed.

4. **Reading List / Book List:** Users can create and manage personalized book lists (e.g., “To Read,” “Favorites,” or “Currently Reading”).

5. **Social Features:** Follow other readers, view their activity, and comment on their reviews.

6. **Recommendations:** Suggest similar books based on user preferences or genre.

These features will help create a rich, interactive platform similar to Fable but tailored to your specific project.

While we don’t expect you to complete all these features, try your best!

### Points to Ponder: 

1. **Clean Code:** Code should be well-structured, readable, and maintainable, following best practices like proper naming conventions, consistent formatting, and comprehensive docstrings.

2. **Architecture and Design:** The project should follow a well-defined architectural pattern that separates concerns, promotes modularity, and supports scalability. Research the most popular approaches and follow one.

3. **Functionality and Completeness:** All required features (e.g., user authentication, book addition, reviews) should be implemented and working as specified, covering both core and additional functionalities.

4. **User Experience (UX) Design:** The interface should provide a smooth, intuitive, and user-friendly experience. The flow of the app should be clear and consistent for users.

5. **Responsible Use of AI Tools:** While AI tools can assist with code generation, a significant portion of the project should showcase your understanding and problem-solving skills. Over-reliance on AI should be avoided, and manually written code should reflect thoughtful design and learning.

**From here on, until the completion of the next four tasks (i.e., Tasks 05–08), all tasks will be related to the Fable-inspired project.**

## TASK 05: The Architect’s Vision – SRS Document

Every successful software project begins with a clear and shared vision. This task challenges you to create a **Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document** for the Fable-like website you are building. The SRS should clearly describe the project’s goals, key features, user needs, and basic design guidelines, providing a shared understanding for developers, designers, and stakeholders.  

Fable is an app where users can interact and discuss the stories of books they’ve read, create lists of books, and search for titles in the bookstore.  

**Objective:**

- Create a lean, clear, and modern SRS document that serves as a blueprint any developer, designer, or stakeholder can quickly understand.  
- Upload the completed SRS document to your GitHub repository.  

**Resource:**

- Draw inspiration and ideas from [Fable](https://fable.co/).  

**Recommended Duration: 2 day**



## TASK 06: Figma UI Challenge

Functionality provides the skeleton of an application, but design gives it a soul. A great developer understands that how a product looks and feels is just as important as how it works. This task challenges you to step into the role of a UI designer, bridging the gap between a structural blueprint and a visually engaging, user-centric interface.  

**Objective:**

- Create Figma designs for the UI/UX of the web app in **Desktop View**.  
- After completion, upload the Figma design link to your task repository.  

**Recommended Duration: 3 days**

## TASK 07: Frontend Development

The frontend of a website is the user's first impression and the core of their experience. It involves designing and building the user interface (UI), covering everything from the smallest button to the overall layout. A well-crafted frontend ensures a seamless and engaging user journey.  

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) is a powerful React framework that enables developers to build fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications.  

**Objectives:**

- Create the frontend for the Fable-like web app you are developing using Next.js.  
- Upon completion, upload all necessary files, excluding the `node_modules` folder, to your repository.  

**Important Things to Note:**

- **Track Hardcoded Values:** Maintain a list of all fields where you are using hardcoded values during frontend development. This will make it easy to replace them with live backend data later.  
- **Prepare for Integration:** Design your frontend components to be flexible and ready for dynamic data. This ensures a smooth and efficient backend integration process.  

**Recommended Duration: 7 days**

## TASK 08: Backend

This task marks a significant step in your app’s development. You are now moving from the visual, user-facing part of the application to its backend—the powerful “engine room” that handles data and logic.  

You will use [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) (a lightweight and flexible web framework) together with REST APIs to build a scalable and organized server-side foundation for your Fable-like app.  

**Objectives:**

- **Construct a Flask Backend:** Use Flask to establish the core framework for your application’s server.  
- **Implement RESTful Endpoints:** Create endpoints to handle user requests such as creating new entries, retrieving data, or updating user profiles.  
- **Manage Application Logic:** Write the code that governs how data is processed, including authentication and database interactions.  

**Deliverables:**

- Upload all backend files (excluding environment-specific or build artifacts) to your repository. This will serve as the server-side counterpart to your frontend.  

**Recommended Duration: 7 days**


## TASK 09: Pytest and Unit Testing  

  
This task is designed to give you hands-on experience with **Pytest** and the principles of **unit testing**. You will not just be writing tests, but also using them as a diagnostic tool to find and fix bugs in a pre-existing codebase. This is a crucial skill for any developer, as it ensures your code is reliable, robust, and ready for future changes.  

**Objectives:** 
1. Complete all the levels of the Pytest challenge provided in this [repository](https://github.com/akdswordguy/DREAMTEAM_task).
2. Write clear and effective test cases for the given codebase.  
3. Use tests as a diagnostic tool to identify and fix bugs.  
4. Ensure that all tests are passing before submission.  
5. Upload your solutions with proper names in your repository.  


**Recommended Duration: 3 days**
